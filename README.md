🎉 About
<br>
This is my very first website, built after 24 days of learning HTML and CSS. Every section, line of code, and style choice was a chance to practice and improve—and this project is the result!
<br>
It’s simple, clean, and made from scratch using only HTML and CSS. The goal? Learn by doing.
